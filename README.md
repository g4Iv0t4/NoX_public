# NoX_public

This open-source software allows you to easily calculate maximum pressure, temperature, work done, piston acceleration, piston speed, and cylinder volume for your engine. 
With 24 different fuel options and the ability to adjust the stoichiometric ratio, you can get results for your specific needs.
Not only does this software give you detailed insights into your engine's performance, but it also displays a chemical formula for balanced combustion and projections for NOX emissions.

Run 
Open your web browser and navigate to Google Colab (colab.research.google.com).

Click on the "New Notebook" button on the homepage to create a new notebook.
In the new notebook, you can either write your code directly or upload an existing Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Upload notebook".

If you are starting a new notebook, you can select the programming language you want to use (Python, R, etc.) by clicking on the "Runtime" menu and selecting "Change runtime type".

Once you have your code in the notebook, you can run each cell of code individually by clicking on the "Play" button next to the cell or by using the keyboard shortcut "Shift+Enter".

If you need to install any additional packages or libraries, you can use the "!pip install" command in a code cell to install them directly in the notebook.

When you are done running your code, you can download the notebook as an .ipynb file or share it with others by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting "Download .ipynb" or "Share".
